   <h1> Minions</h1>

   <p Minions are small, yellow, pill-shaped creatures that have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from single-celled organisms into beings that exist only to serve history's most evil masters1234. They accidentally end up killing all their masters, including a Tyrannosaurus, a caveman, a Pharaoh and his subjects, and Count Dracula1. In the movie, Minions Stuart, Kevin, and Bob are recruited by Scarlet Overkill, a supervillain who, alongside her inventor husband Herb, hatches a plot to take over the world2.
